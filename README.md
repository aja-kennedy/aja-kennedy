- 👋 Hi, I’m @aja-kennedy
- 👀 I’m interested in urban economics, particularly in housing and land use policy, residential segregation, neighborhood change, and transit oriented development.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning how to estimate structural urban models!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to the effect of government policy on neighborhood change.
- 📫 To reach me, find me on LinkedIn or email me at aja.kennedy(at)tufts.edu.
